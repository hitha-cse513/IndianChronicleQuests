        <h2>About Ima Keithel</h2>
        <p>The seven sisters of northeast India are exceptional locations to experience nature. 
            Among these, the Ima Keithel market in Manipur's Imphal stands out for its distinctive features. 
            Located at Imphal's Khwairamband, the Ima Keithel, or Mother's Market, is the world's largest all-women market, boasting a 500-year-old history. This unique market dates back to the 16th century and originally had only a few stalls. 
            Today, it features as many as 5,000 women shopkeepers who hold licenses passed down through generations, making it the first-of-its-kind for several reasons.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>According to historical texts, a forced labour system named 'Lallup-Kaba' was imposed in the kingdom of Manipur, requiring all men from the community to serve in the army for specific years. 
            With men in the army, women stepped forward to ensure their families continued to earn a livelihood, breaking the stereotype that only men should provide for the family. 
            Initially, a few women began trading in the market, and gradually more women joined, putting up their stalls in a specific area. 
            Over time, the Ima Keithel market was recognized as an all-women market, and men were denied permission to set up stalls. 
            The government of Manipur regards these women traders as the state's pride and is committed to protecting and promoting their entrepreneurial skills.</p>
        <h2>Characteristics of the Ima Keithel Market</h2>
        <p>The market has an unusual rule that only married women can trade here. 
            Such customs and traditions have been carried out for years and centuries. 
            According to officials, married women who want to start their businesses can take a loan from the union and set up their stalls. 
            The loans can be paid back over a period of time to the union. A women's union supervises, controls, and monitors the entire market. 
            It's divided into three buildings- New Market, Ema Market, and Laxmi Market, and covers almost a three km area. 
            The Imphal Municipal Council also looks after the site for development and maintenance. </p>
        <p>One can find delicacies from traditional Manipuri sweets to fresh starfruit, bamboo shoots, lotus flower beans and fresh or fermented fish or delicious warm meals made on the spot. 
            One can shop for fabrics, rugs, terra cotta pottery sold from a family thatâ€™s been doing it for three generations, incense, festival supplies and authentic handicrafts.
            The only way a woman can become a vendor is if she gets nominated by an existing member. There are families that have been working there for generations. 
            According to CNN, men may come to the market but only to buy goods, to do the heavy lifting, guarding or deliver women cups of chai.</p>
        <h2>Women Empowerment</h2>
        <p>Ima Keithel, a major source of sustenance and a primary market for the local economy, faced severe setbacks in the 19th century due to British reforms. 
            These adversely affected Manipur's socio-economic fabric, leading to a revolt by women vendors against unjust policies. 
            The British tried to crush the agitation by selling the market's buildings to foreigners, but the women successfully thwarted these attempts.
            Despite the movement dying down during World War II, the proactive role played by women left an indelible mark on society, symbolizing gender equality and empowerment. </p>
            <p>Post-independence, the market revived and reignited the state's socio-economic engine. 
                Managed by a union of married women, the market operates with a credit system allowing traders to borrow money for goods. 
                In February 2023, B20 delegates from the G20 forum visited the market, acknowledging its significant contribution to women empowerment, entrepreneurship, and the grassroots economy of Manipur.</p>
