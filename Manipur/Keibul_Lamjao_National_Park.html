        <h2>History</h2>

            The species of deer was almost extinct by then, however, re-discovered in 1954. 
            Hunting was once again allowed in the sanctuary in the areas that were not the habitat of the deer. 
            The park was officially declared as a sanctuary in 1966 and 1977, it was declared as the Keibul Lamjao National Park, and no hunting has been permitted since then.</p>
