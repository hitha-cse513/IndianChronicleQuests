        <h2>Local Attractions</h2>
        <h5>Umiam Lake</h5>
        <p>Umiam Lake, located 15 kilometers north of Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya, holds a fascinating legend behind its name. 
            In Khasi folklore, two sisters journeyed from heaven to Meghalaya, the 'abode of clouds,' but the younger sister lost her way. 
            Overwhelmed with grief, the elder sister continuously shed tears, which formed the picturesque Umiam Lake. 
            This man-made reservoir was created for hydroelectric power generation, surrounded by the lush green East Khasi hills, offering a stunning panorama for nature lovers. 
            The lake's beauty is further accentuated by its surroundings, with thick coniferous forests and a vast expanse of 222 square kilometers. 
            Visitors can enjoy the mesmerizing sunrise, explore the adjacent park for picnics, or partake in boating and water sports. 
            The lake also provides a glimpse into the local way of life, with natives collecting twigs and grass, and fishermen gliding in their canoes across the tranquil waters. 
            As seasons change, the shores of Umiam Lake transform; adorned with vibrant Gulmohar trees in summer and revealing an azure landscape as the water recedes in winter.
        </p>
        <h5>Elephant Falls</h5>
        <p>Named after an elephant-like stone at its base, Elephant Falls is a renowned waterfall near Shillong, popular for its three accessible layers. 
            Originally called 'Ka Kshaid Lai Pateng Khohsiew' by the Khasi locals, meaning 'The Three Step Waterfalls,' it offers a picturesque sight with each tier having its unique charm. 
            The first fall is broad, nestled amidst dense trees, while the second cascades down in thin strands, often less prominent in winter. 
            The third and tallest fall is the most striking, with water flowing like a sheet of milk against dark rocks. 
            Despite the disintegration of the elephant-shaped rock that gave the falls their name, the beauty of Elephant Falls remains captivating. 
            It serves as an ideal spot to immerse oneself in nature's beauty and capture unforgettable moments. 
            Just 12 km from Shillong, it is a popular stopover for tourists exploring Meghalaya's scenic wonders. 
            The falls' allure, coupled with its easy accessibility, makes it a must-visit destination for nature lovers and photographers alike.

        <p>At the height of 6449 ft or 1965 m above sea level, Shillong Peak is the highest point of Shillong. 
            It offers a breathtaking panoramic view of the entire city, the Himalayas, its waterfalls as well as of the Bangladesh plains. 
            A telescope is available for tourists to get a bird's eye view. 
            Trekking up to this semi-circular Shillong Peak is highly recommended for the best views but it is often bounded by heavy fog.

            It is said that Shillong gets its name from the Shillong Peak itself. Regional tales tell that the patron deity 'Leishyllong' resides in the hills and protects the city from all evils. 
            The U Shulong site at the top of the peak is sacred and every spring, a ritual is organised there. 
            The Shillong Peak is situated at the air force base and features a radar station of the Indian Air Force.
