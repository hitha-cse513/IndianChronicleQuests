        <h2>About Mawlynnong</h2>
        <p>Mawlynnong is renowned as one of the cleanest villages in Asia, but a more fitting title is God’s Own Garden. 
            The village features fruit orchards, rushing streams, evergreen surroundings, swaying palms, and the well-preserved traditions of the Khasis, all set against the picturesque backdrop of Meghalaya’s southern ranges. 
            Here, you’ll find Meghalaya’s most famous icon – the Nohwet Living Root Bridge. 
            This bridge was created by weaving the roots of the Ficus Elastica tree around a framework, a process continued over generations. 
            These living root bridges are a hallmark of Khasi traditional architecture, crucial for connecting villages in the steep valleys and mountains, and facilitating travel and trade to the plains.</p>
        <h2>Local Attractions</h2>
        <h5>Sky Walk</h5>
        <p>Located 2 km from the Mawlynnong Bus Stop, the Sky Walk, also known as Nohwet Viewpoint, is a popular attraction in Mawlynnong, East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya. This viewpoint is among the top places to visit in Mawlynnong and one of the best spots to experience Meghalaya Tourism.

            The Sky Walk is an 85-foot-high eco-friendly structure made entirely of bamboo poles tied to branches of six trees using jute and bamboo ropes, with no nails or metal involved. 
            Visitors must climb four circular layers of bamboo ladders stretching across the tree branches. 
            At the top, there is a square platform offering a bird's-eye view of Mawlynnong village and the Bangladesh plains.
            
            Designed by a local school teacher, Rishop Khongthongreh, this structure has become a famous tourist spot in Mawlynnong. 
            The bamboo walking path is a bit challenging to navigate, but the climb, which takes around 30 minutes, rewards visitors with stunning and breathtaking views of the Indo-Bangladesh plains.</p>
        <h5>Church Of Epiphany</h5>
        <p>The Church of Epiphany, a century-old church located in East Khasi Hills, Meghalaya, is one of the must-see tourist places in Mawlynnong.

            Built in 1902 by Welsh Christian missionaries, the Church of Epiphany is the only church in Mawlynnong village. 
            Legend has it that these missionaries arrived from Bangladesh in the 19th century, bringing with them a strong tradition of Christianity that the village has followed ever since. 
            The residents of Mawlynnong credit the missionaries with instilling in them the values of cleanliness, linking this tradition to their Christian faith. 
            They believe the missionaries taught them that cleanliness is a way to reach God.
            
            Surrounded by narrow stone paths adorned with plants bearing orange flowers, the black and white church structure exudes a unique old-world charm. 
            Having recently celebrated its hundredth anniversary, the church remains a serene and soothing place for visitors. 
            Notably, no buildings in the village rise above the church spire, preserving its prominence and tranquil atmosphere.</p>
        <h5>Byrdaw Falls</h5>
        <p>Located 23 km from Mawlynnong and 70 km from Shillong, Byrdaw Falls is a captivating waterfall situated at Pomshutia village in the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya. Found along the Shillong - Dawki Road, it stands out as one of the most beautiful waterfalls in East Khasi Hills and a popular destination in Mawlynnong.

            Byrdaw Falls descends in two tiers from a height of approximately 150 m into a pool below. 
            The waterfall is particularly stunning during the monsoon season. Visitors can even venture behind the waterfall to experience its mighty flow. 
            To reach the falls, one must trek 2 km from Pomshutia village, which takes about 30 minutes. Proper roads and footpaths have been constructed for easy access. 
            Additionally, there is a cave located just behind the falls. 
            It is advisable to hire a guide when visiting the falls due to its remote location.</p>
