        <h2>About Nohkalikai Falls</h2>
        <p>The fourth highest waterfalls in the world, Nohkalikai falls plunge some 335 meters from a verdant cliff to the ground giving the portrayal of immense and natural magnificence. 
            The pride of the state of Meghalaya, the falls are one of the most beautiful and grand waterfalls in the country. 
            Tucked in between the evergreen rainforest of the Khasi Hill and flowing with all its majesty and might, the falls plunges into a lagoon that is as blue as the afternoon sky.</p>
        <h2>History of Nohkalikai Falls</h2>
        <p>Nohkalikai Falls have been named so after a tragic Khasi legend. 
            According to the legend, a woman named Likai had to remarry after her husband, who was a porter by profession, died on a trip carrying iron to Sylhet. 
            Ka Likai (Ka is the prefix given for the female gender in Khasi) was left with her infant girl with no means of income so she had to become a porter herself. 
            Her work required her to leave her daughter unattended for long intervals but when she would be at home she would spend most of her time taking care of her infant. 
            Ka Likai, who married a second time, couldn’t pay attention to her second husband. 
            The jealous husband killed the infant and cooked her meat after throwing away her head and bones.
            When Ka Likai returned home, she saw nobody in the house but a meal was ready. 
            She wanted to go look for her daughter but she ate the meat as she was tired from work. 
            Ka Likai usually had a betel leaf after her meals but she found a severed finger near the place where she usually cut betel nuts and betel leaves. 
            Ka Likai realized what had happened in her absence and went mad with anger and started running as she swung a hatchet in her hand. 
            She ran off the edge of the plateau and the waterfall where she jumped from was named Nohkalikai Falls after her.
             ‘Noh’ means to jump in Khasi.</p>
