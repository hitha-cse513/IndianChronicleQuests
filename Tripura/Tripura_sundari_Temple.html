        <h2>About Tripura Sundari Temple</h2>
        <p>Tripura Sundari Temple, located in Udaipur about 55 km from Agartala, Tripura, is a 500-year-old temple, making it the oldest in the Udaipur district. As one of the 51 Shakti Peethas, it holds significant religious importance, being the site where the toe of Sati's right foot is believed to have fallen. The temple, also known as Kurma Peeth due to its tortoise shape, was built in 1501 and is dedicated to the goddess Kali. Throughout the year, it attracts numerous tourists and pilgrims, especially during the vibrant Diwali festival when devotees bathe in the temple's fish-filled tank.</p>

        <p>Legend has it that Lord Vishnu cut Sati into 51 pieces with his Sudarshana Chakra, and the sites where her parts fell became known as Shaktipeethas. Tripura Sundari Temple, also known as Matabari, is renowned for its priests in red robes who serve the deity. The temple's vivid-red shikhara and the constant stream of pilgrims performing animal sacrifices make it a striking and holy Hindu shrine. This majestic temple remains one of the most attractive tourist destinations in Tripura, drawing hundreds of visitors daily.</p>
        <h2>Legend of Tripura Sundari Temple</h2>
        <p>According to the legend, Mata Sati's toe of the right foot fell at this place. King Dhanya Manikya who was the ruler of Tripura in the 15th century had a dream asking him to install the idol of Goddess Tripura Sundari in the temple present on the hilltop. However, this temple was already dedicated to Lord Vishnu which is why the king could not decide how to install another idol in the temple which was already devoted to Lord Vishnu. However, the repetition of this message by the oracle made the king decide to follow its command and thus Tripura Sundar Temple, which is 500 years old, came into existence.</p>
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>The striking Tripura Sundari Temple is compact, measuring 24 square feet at its base and reaching a height of 75 feet. Within this sacred space, Goddess Parvati is worshipped under the names Tripurasundari, Tripureshwari, and Soroshi. The temple's architecture is unique, resembling a tortoise with a roof shaped like the humped back of a tortoise, earning it the name Kurma Peetha (Kurma meaning tortoise). The square sanctum with a conical dome was constructed in 1501 by Maharaja Dhanya Manikya Debbarma.</p>

        <p>Inside this magnificent temple are two identical images of the deity. The taller image, standing at 5 feet, is known as Tripura Sundari, while the smaller one, at 2 feet, is called Chhotima. The idol of Maa Kali, revered in the temple as Soroshi, is crafted from reddish-black kasti stone. It is said that the smaller idol, Chhotima, was carried into battle by the king.</p>
        <h2>Poojas and festivals in Tripura Sundari Temple</h2>
        <p>Every year, a renowned Mela takes place near the Tripura Sundari Temple during Diwali. This event attracts over two lakh pilgrims who gather to participate in the festivities. Diwali, celebrated with immense enthusiasm, draws crowds from across the country to offer prayers to Goddess Sati or Maa Kali. Other major festivals celebrated at the temple include Durga Puja and Kali Puja.

            Outside the temple, numerous stalls sell flowers and baskets of offerings for visitors to present to the deity inside the temple in exchange for Prasadam. A specialty here is the brown milk Pedas, which devotees often purchase to take home. To the temple's east lies the famous Kalyan Sagar Lake, home to fish and large tortoises. Devotees can be seen feeding them with puffed rice, known as Muri, and biscuits.</p>
