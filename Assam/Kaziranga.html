        <h2>About Kaziranga National Park</h2>
        <p>Home to the largest population of the one-horned rhino on earth, Kaziranga National Park is one of India’s national treasures in terms of flora and fauna. 
            Located in the state of Assam in North-Eastern India, its total area is shared by the districts of Nagaon, Golaghat and Karbi Anglong placing it roughly at the centre of the state. 
            Approximately around five hours by road from Guwahati, Kaziranga National Park stands tall as the epitome of successful wildlife conservation in India. 
            In 1985, it was awarded the status of a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.</p>
        <h2>Wildlife</h2>
        <p>Lying on the floodplains of the mighty river Brahmaputra, rich vegetation covers almost the entirety of Kaziranga National Park. 
            Receiving massive amounts of rainfall each year, at times even crossing dangerous levels, this national park is characterised by tall elephant grass, marshlands and tall tropical broadleaf forests. 
            Here, a wide variety of fauna thrives including the one-horned rhino, Asiatic elephants, wild water buffalo, leopards and Royal Bengal Tigers. 
            Kaziranga National Park is also listed officially as a Tiger reserve and is home to one of the world’s largest population of tigers.</p>
        <p>Different types of birds can also be spotted here at the park. A popular migratory location for birds who fly down from the north, one can spot various birds such as the black-nested stork, the lesser white-fronted goose, ferruginous duck and Baer's pochard duck to name a few. 
            Other notable bird families which can be seen here include the great Indian hornbill and wreathed hornbill among many others.</p>
        <h2>Activities</h2>
        <p>Popular things one can enjoy in the National Park include:-</p>
            <h5>Jungle Jeep Safari</h5>
            <p>With three entry-exit points in different districts of Assam, Kaziranga National Park features four zones where visitors can enjoy sightings of the one-horned rhinos, exotic animals, and mesmerizing landscapes on a jeep safari.

                The Eastern Range of this park is the most favorable place to sight birds due to the numerous water lagoons in this region. 
                Pelicans, Whistling Teals, and Greater Adjutant Storks are some of the unique birds you can spot with your eyes and camera in Kaziranga National Park.</p>
            <h5>Elephant Safari</h5>

                 In the evening, visitors can enjoy authentic cultural programs that showcase the rich heritage and culture of Assam.</p>
        <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
        <p>In addition to its wildlife and cultural significance, Kaziranga plays a crucial role in conservation efforts, serving as a sanctuary for endangered species and contributing to the preservation of Assam's natural heritage. 
            The park's successful conservation programs and initiatives make it an important landmark in the global fight against biodiversity loss and habitat destruction.</p>
        <p>The property receives the highest legal protection under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and the Indian Forest Act, 1927/Assam Forest Regulation 1891. 
            With over a century of protection, the park has seen a dramatic recovery of the rhino population. 
            Declared a Tiger Reserve in 2007, the park has benefited from six additions to its area, improving management and protection efforts. Government support at both national and regional levels, along with the involvement of national and international conservation organizations, further enhances its protection. Managed under the Assam Forest Department and guided by a legally approved Management Plan, the property is regarded as one of the best-protected and conserved sites in India.
            However, key threats include rhino poaching, riverbank erosion, invasive species, tourism pressure, heavy highway traffic, and livestock grazing, especially in the newly added areas of the park.</p>
        <h2>Best time to Visit</h2>
        <p>Kaziranga Park remain closed from June to September every year for the visitors.
