        <h2>About Sivasagar</h2>
        <p>One of the holistic towns, Sivasagar formally called as Sibsagar is located in the upper ranges of Assam. 
            This popular destination in Assam is set amidst the rich and diverse biodiversity surrounded by many historic attractions. 
            Tourism in Sivasagar is popular for its Ahom monuments and palaces which are a work of excellence. 
            And circled by the lovely ambience and graceful hills this place has a number of other attractions as well.</p>
        <h2>Historical Importance</h2>
        <p>Sivasagar, formerly known as Rangpur, was the capital of the Ahom Kingdom from 1699 to 1788. 
            The Ahoms ruled Assam for six centuries until their kingdom fell to the Burmese in 1819. 
            The British liberated the province in 1825 and annexed it in 1826, dividing it into three sub-divisions for administrative purposes. 
            Originally named 'Kalansupar' after Kalansu Gohain, the town was later called Shivpur. After the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826, the British renamed it Sibsagar. 
            During British rule, the Sibsagar district included three sub-divisions: Sibsagar, Jorhat, and Golaghat. 
            In 1912, the district headquarters moved to Jorhat, making Sibsagar a sub-divisional headquarters until 1983, when Sibsagar and Golaghat were declared new districts by the Government of Assam.</p>
        <h2>Cultural Heritage of Sibsagar </h2>
        <p>Initially, the Ahom clan who migrated from the Mong Mao province of Southern China used to follow a religion based on ritual oriented ancestor worship. 
            Later Swargadeo Rudra Singha embraced Hinduism and over the time other religions too flourished in his capital. 
            He also adopted Assamese as an official language of the Ahom kingdom. 
            The Ahom rulers were also a strong proponent of sports, dance and music. 
            The king commissioned the construction of 'Rang Ghar' (a house of entertainment) in 1747 AD which is now believed to be one of the oldest surviving amphitheatres in Asia. 
            It was at this place where Bihu was fostered as a cultural identity of Assam. 
            </p>
        <p>Sibsagar was once a majestic city and it has witnessed some of the most remarkable transitions in the cultural history of Assam. 
            From archaeology to culture it speaks loud about the deeds of the great Ahom rulers who shaped the future of the Brahmaputra Valley. 
            Such illustrious past and intangible splendours make Sivasagar the heritage capital of Assam. </p>
        <h2>Places of Interest around Sivasagar Town</h2>
        <h5>Sibsagar Tank and Group of Temples</h5>
        <p>Sivasagar, named after the Sibsagar tank (Borpukhuri), is renowned for its three Hindu temples and rich heritage. 
            The Sibsagar tank, a manmade water body commissioned by Queen Ambika in 1734 AD, showcases the advanced hydrology of the Ahom period. 
            Covering 257 acres with a consistent water depth of 27 feet, it stands higher than the rest of the town. 
            Surrounding the tank are the Siva Dol, Vishnu Dol, and Devi Dol temples, along with a Tai Ahom museum. Notably, Siva Dol is the tallest Shiva temple in India. 
            During winter, migratory birds flock to the tank, which also features a watchtower on its eastern bank.</p>
        <h5>Rang Ghar</h5>
        <p>Rang Ghar, meaning "House of Entertainment" in Assamese, is one of Asia's oldest surviving amphitheatres and sports pavilions. 
            Originally built with bamboo and wood by Swargadeo Rudra Singha, it was rebuilt by his son Swargadeo Pramatta Singha between 1744-1750 AD. 
            The double-storeyed structure, typical of Ahom architecture, features an oval amphitheatre with a roof shaped like an inverted Ahom longboat. 
            Made from thin bricks and organic cement, it remains cool year-round. 
            The Ahom kings and nobles used it to watch buffalo fights, cockfights, and dance performances, especially during the Rongali Bihu festival.</p>
        <h5>Talatal Ghar</h5>
        <p>Talatal Ghar, meaning "underground home" in Assamese, was commissioned by Swargadeo Rudra Singha in 1698 AD as the military base of the Ahom kingdom. 
            It is the largest of all Ahom architectural structures. The building has three underground floors and two secret tunnels for royal escape routes. 
            Located near Rang Ghar and Joysagar Tank, only the upper portion is accessible to tourists today, while the underground floors are sealed off.</p>
