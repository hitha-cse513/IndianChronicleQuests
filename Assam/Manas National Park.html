        <h2>Conservation efforts in Manas National Park</h2>
        <p>From 1980s till 2003, the park was engulfed in armed conflict and it was a tumultuous time for the national park. 
            This caused one-horned rhinoceros in Manas (endemic to the Indian sub-continent) to be wiped out. 
            In 1992, UNESCO declared Manas as a World Heritage Site in danger due to armed conflict in the region, and poaching activities.
            
            In 2003, local leaders and activists formed the Manas Maozigendri Ecotourism Society in Koklabari Mouza, Baksa district, BTC, focusing on a community-based movement that successfully converted poachers into conservationists. They reintroduced rhinos into Manas National Park from Kaziranga, increasing the population of one-horned rhinoceros to 40. This conservation success led UNESCO to remove Manas from the World Heritage site in danger list in 2011. 
            Additionally, swamp deer, previously extinct in the park, have been rehabilitated.</p>
        <h2>Protection and management requirements outlined by UNESCO</h2>
        <p>The property, with six designations including World Heritage Site and National Park, enjoys top legal protection under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and the Indian Forest Act, 1927/Assam Forest Regulation 1891.

            A comprehensive Management Plan ensures effective patrolling and enforcement against encroachment, grazing, and poaching.

            The property houses 400 varieties of wild rice, making biodiversity management crucial for food security. 
            Infrastructure, skilled personnel, and scientific research are vital for habitat management and wildlife recovery. 
            Effective tourism facilities and visitor information are prioritized. 
            Sustainable financing is essential for long-term management, balancing conservation with resource extraction in buffer zones. 
            Local community involvement in protection efforts is a key objective. 
            Extending the property to align with national park boundaries and establishing a transboundary World Heritage site with Bhutan could enhance coordination and protection.</p>
