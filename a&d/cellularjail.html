        <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
        <p>The Cellular Jail, also known as Kala Pani, was a colonial prison located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India. It was used by the British to exile political prisoners during the struggle for India's independence. The construction of the jail began in 1896 and was completed in 1906. The jail's remote location and harsh conditions made it a dreaded punishment for those who opposed British rule.</p>
        
        <p>During the Indian independence movement, many notable freedom fighters were imprisoned here, including Batukeshwar Dutt, Yogendra Shukla, and Veer Savarkar. The Cellular Jail stands as a witness to the sacrifices made by these revolutionaries, who endured unimaginable hardships for the sake of the nation's freedom.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>The Cellular Jail is a poignant symbol of the sacrifices made by countless freedom fighters. It serves as a reminder of the brutalities faced by Indian revolutionaries and their undying spirit for independence. Today, the jail complex is a national memorial and is visited by thousands of people who come to pay their respects and learn about its history.</p>

        <h2>Architectural Design</h2>
        <p>The Cellular Jail was designed with seven wings radiating from a central watchtower, resembling the spokes of a wheel. Each wing had three stories and numerous small, isolated cells to prevent communication among prisoners. The design ensured maximum security and minimal chance of escape.</p>
        
        <p>The jail's architecture is unique and was intended to isolate inmates from each other and the outside world. The central watchtower was strategically placed to allow guards to keep an eye on all the wings simultaneously. The solitary cells measured about 4.5 by 2.7 meters, with a single ventilation window high up on the back wall, which added to the prisoners' sense of isolation and despair.</p>

        <h2>Life in the Cellular Jail</h2>
        <p>Life in the Cellular Jail was extremely harsh and brutal. Prisoners were subjected to inhumane treatment, including physical and mental torture. They were forced to perform hard labor, such as grinding coconuts and extracting oil, constructing roads, and other manual tasks under strict supervision.</p>
        
        <p>Prisoners were often shackled and subjected to severe punishments for the slightest offenses. The lack of adequate food, medical care, and sanitation added to their misery. Despite these conditions, the spirit of the freedom fighters remained unbroken. They continued to resist and organize protests, even within the confines of the jail.</p>

        <h2>Memorial and Museum</h2>
        <p>Today, the Cellular Jail complex has been transformed into a national memorial. The government of India has preserved it as a symbol of the sacrifices made by freedom fighters. The memorial includes a museum, an art gallery, and a light and sound show that depicts the history of the Indian independence movement and the role of the Cellular Jail.</p>
        
        <p>The museum showcases various artifacts, photographs, and documents related to the freedom struggle and the lives of the prisoners. The light and sound show, conducted in the evenings, narrates the story of the jail and its inmates, bringing to life the trials and tribulations they faced.</p>
