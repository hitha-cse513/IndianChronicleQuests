        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Located near the Indo-Myanmar border in Champhai District, approximately 245 km from Aizawl, Murlen National Park is renowned as one of the last sanctuaries for Mizoram's state bird, Vavu (Mrs. Hume's Pheasant). Spanning 100 sq.km of untouched forests, the park features sub-tropical evergreen and sub-montane forests, providing habitat to a variety of mammals and birds. The landscape includes steep rocky cliffs adorned with honeycombs and teeming with swifts and swallows. Murlen National Park is an excellent destination for bird-watching enthusiasts.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Murlen National Park, established in 1991, is a relatively young addition to Mizoram's conservation efforts. The park was created to protect the rich biodiversity of the region, including rare species of flora and fauna. Over the years, it has become known as a vital sanctuary for the state bird, Vavu (Mrs. Hume's Pheasant), which was facing threats of extinction. The park's history is a testament to Mizoram's commitment to preserving its natural heritage and promoting eco-tourism.It covers an area of approximately 200 square kilometers.</p>
        <h2>Flora and Fauna</h2>
        <p>Murlen National Park, sprawling over 100 square kilometers with altitudes ranging from 400 to 1900 meters, is a treasure trove of biodiversity. Its subtropical climate sees heavy rainfall from May to September and mild winters from November to February, nurturing six distinct forest types: tropical semi-evergreen, subtropical broadleaved, submontane, bamboo, grassland, and cliff vegetation. These forests provide a rich habitat for a diverse range of flora and fauna, including many endemic and endangered species.</p>

        <p>    At lower altitudes, tropical semi-evergreen forests dominate, hosting a variety of wildlife such as tigers, leopards, bears, deer, and primates. As you ascend, subtropical broadleaved forests take over, featuring oak, laurel, and magnolia trees adorned with orchids and supporting numerous birds and insects. The highest altitudes are covered by submontane forests, characterized by coniferous and rhododendron trees, home to species like the red panda, Himalayan serow, black bear, and Himalayan monal.</p>
            
        <p>    Additionally, the park boasts bamboo forests vital for the region's ecology and economy, grasslands, and cliff vegetation. Notably, the discovery of the Murlen keelback snake in 2018 highlights the park's role in preserving unique and rare species. With about 150 species of orchids and a diverse array of epiphytic plants like ferns, mosses, and fungi, Murlen National Park is a haven for nature enthusiasts and researchers alike.</p>
        <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
